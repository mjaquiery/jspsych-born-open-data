## Putting it to Use

The goal of today is to leave with a workflow which implements born open data in your own workflow, and with an understanding of how to implement this into your other projects as they are developed.

For this session, you'll need a project of your own - perhaps one of:
* A copy of a recent project where you've already collected data
* A project currently under development

You'll work at your own pace, with support from your peers and the workshop instructors and helpers to implement a born open workflow in your project.
There are some points below for reference:

### Creating an OSF Project and Component

### Creating an OSF PAT

### Writing the save data scripts

### Testing!
