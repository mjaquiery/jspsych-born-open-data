We'll be creating a new project on the Open Science Framework and adding a component which will house the data we upload.

1. Open [test.osf.io](https://test.osf.io/) in your browser and log in
2. Click 'Create new project'

Then fill in the form:

Then click 'Go to project'

3. Create a new project component.
This component will house the data.

Fill in the form, making sure you select the **location** as `Germany - Frankfurt`.

4. Navigate to the new component and give it an open license.
CC-BY 4.0 is a good license to use - people are free to reuse the contents provided that they acknowledge that they got it from you.

Now we have provided a license, let's make this component public.
Click 'Make Public'

5. Make a note of the component's id - we'll need that later.
You can find the id in the browser's address bar; it's the part that's highlighted in the screenshot below.

You're now all set up with an OSF project which has a special component ready to hold all the raw data.

> ## DOIs and data citations
> You can create a DOI for your data to make it easy to cite.
> This is as simple as clicking the 'Create DOI' button and then confirming your choice.
